                 The Harbour</a>
  <p>
The inner harbour protects boats from wave and storm damage and provides a trading hub and a staging area for boat repairs and refits, with different marinas for small and medium-sized boats connected to the Boat Services Ring behind the harbour front. It's the beating heart of the Island's maritime community

                 Boat Services Ring</a>
  <p>
The Boat Services Ring has facilities for small and medium-sized boats, accessed from the central harbour through the marinas or from the adjacent Residential Ring through the Ringway. It provides the usual boat repair and refit facilities via a series of dry docks and covered areas. People working here live in the  Residential Ring or commute from a nearby coastal town via the central harbour

                 The Ringway</a>
  <p>
Transportation rings speed movement around the island for pedestrians, vehicles and boats. They have bridges over 'canals' (i.e. continuous open water) to allow free movement of both land and water traffic and are placed at strategic points between the other Rings to reduce crowding on the water surface as well as facilitate transport

                 The Island</a>
  <p>
The symmetric design of the Island provides defence against storms and wave action generally and is an efficient way to organise the services necessary to human settlement such as food production/distribution and transport. Islands are designed for very long lives so it's important that they be resistant to sea conditions and easily maintained
