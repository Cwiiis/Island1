we know that we can change waste paper or plastics to rigid or flexible high-buoyancy plastic foams, and also that we can incorporate various forms of glass fibre into these foams to convert them into high-strength GRP foams, which can be further extended by processing them into filaments to create yarn for flexible and light ropes, nets, webbing and fabrics. To produce a durable range of materials, we need to do three things:

1. Massively increase fire resistance and lifespan:
This can be achieved by:
Formulating to create basic resistance to fire and smoke production, e.g. by charring
Incorporating anti-oxidants and other fire/smoke/auto-catalysis retardents
Using an inert gas to blow the foam;

2. Design elastomeric and filamental versions of these foams:
This is necessary to provide a range of flexible multi-functional materials;

3. Create a very high impact and wear resistant foam:
 To provide the outer wear coat that enables tough use and long life. It would need nylon-like toughness, with glass or carbon fibre to provide strength and impact resistance, embedded in a fairly high-density (but still bouyant) foam matrix. It would also need very high resistance to UV and chemicals.
