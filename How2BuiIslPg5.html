<h1>AN INITIAL ISLAND DESIGN</h1>

<p>
The island consists of a series of concentric rings surrounding a central harbour. The rings are of two types, those containing facilities for specific activities - activity rings, such as the inner harbour ring surrounding the central harbour, and transport rings - ringways - consisting of a 'canal' and roadway with bridges to allow boat access and vehicle crossing; ringways are provided as necessary for easy access to all areas (and to create open water between surface structures for marine growth). Activity Rings, working from the harbour ring outwards, are:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Harbour Ring</strong>, which has several marinas attached, to contain moorings for small and medium-sized boats;</li>
<li><strong>The Boat Services Ring</strong> of boat maintenance and provisioning services at the  rear of the harbour ring (surrounded in turn by the first transport ringway);</li>
<li><strong>The Residential Ring</strong> of housing and 'village' centres, placed as near the centre as practicable for protection from heavy seas;</li>
<li><strong>The Agricultural Ring</strong> with greenhouses, hydroponics etc.;</li>
<li><strong> The Commercial/Industrial Ring</strong> with professional, processing and warehousing facilities;</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The final, outer, ring, is a much wider one largely consisting of aquaculture areas for growing seaweeds and shellfish, with some associated structures and berthing facilities for larger boats; this outer ring has a secondary (though major) function of damping waves and storms to protect the inner facilities.
