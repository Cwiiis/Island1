<h1>MATERIALS</h1>

<p>

<p>
We could convert materials like waste plastics and glass into high-specification structural foams and composites and use them to build inexpensive floating structures in a wide range of designs which have a useful lifespan. There are three physical pre-requisites for this:
<ul>
<li>Permanent buoyancy: provided by very tough, long-lived foam modules, which are highly UV, fire and seawater resistant</li>
<li>Stability: provided mainly by sea anchors not rigidly attached to the seabed, but also as a by-product of careful design</li>
<li>Avoidance of wave and storm damage: absorbing and dissipating wave and wind energy by reacting to it with controlled resistance.</li>
</ul>
</p>
These high-performance materials can be further extended by processing them into filaments to create yarn for flexible and light ropes, nets, webbing and fabrics. To produce a durable range of materials, we need to do three things:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Massively increase fire resistance and lifespan. This can be achieved by:
<ul>
<li>Formulating the plastic to create basic resistance to fire and smoke production, e.g. by charring</li>
<li>Incorporating anti-oxidants and other fire/smoke/auto-catalysis retardents</li>
<li>Using an inert gas to blow the foam;
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<li>Design flexible and filamental versions of these foams to provide a range of flexible multi-functional materials. A flexible version could be used, for example, to wrap the rigid core of the buoyancy modules to improve impact resistance and remove easily damaged sharp corners. Filamental versions could incorporate simple glass fibres for improved strength generally., or use continuous glass fibre, as in fibre-optics, to create super-strong materials for special uses, such as hawsers and space-covering tarpaulins;</li>
</p>
<li>Create a very high impact and wear resistant foam for the outer wear coat that enables tough use and long life. It would require:
<ul>
<li>Nylon-like toughness of the plastic to be foamed</li>
<li>Adding glass or carbon fibre to provide additional strength and impact resistance</li>
<li>Creating a fairly high-density (but still bouyant) foam matrix from the mix</li>
<li>Very high resistance to UV and chemicals.</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ol>
