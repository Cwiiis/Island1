                 The SPAR</a>
  <p>
This is the major source of buoyancy for FARs or islands, with a rigid foam interior covered with a layer of flexible foam and a tough outer skin

          <h2>The Basic CORNER</h2>

                 The CORNER</a>
  <p>
Also buoyant and with the same structure as the SPAR, CORNERs are used to join SPARs together at angles of 60 or 120 degrees to create a variety of designs

                 SPARs and CORNERs</a>
  <p>
SPARs can be combined with CORNERs to create rings, zigzags and many other structures

                FAR </a>
  <p>
FARs can be designed to resist wave and storm damage to themselves as well as protect sections of coastline or coastal facilities such as harbours
