<h1>FUNCTIONALITY</h1>

<p>
Though this initial design concentrates on basic materials and structure, there will also have to be a considerable amount of detailed functional design/development to create a working island with a resident population. Creating detailed prescriptions for specific functions seems premature before the design of the island itself is even complete (or even proscriptions against particular approaches), but creating and debating some general principles that make sense of the peculiar environment which is a floating island doesn't seem out of place, and there are at least two sorts of principles to consider, viz: ideas that lead to general improvements in the end-product, e.g. sustainability, and specific constraints on ways of doing things that reflect the nature of the environment, e.g. not building upwards. Taking these in turn:
</p>

<p>
<h4>A few guiding ideas:</h4>
</p>
<ul>
<p>
<li><strong>Being people-friendly</strong>: i.e. enable engagement, ownership and enjoyment by those who will be living with the technology day to day, as well as providing a safe and protective environment, the minimum requirement for which would be for all buoyancy units to be fitted with walkways and have climbable side-access with hand-holds, e.g. wide netting or rope ladders; the maximum, e.g. for a floating pier, would need considerable attention paid to safety details such as guard rails and safe unit-to-unit access.</li>
</p>

<p>
<li><strong>KISC - Keep It Simple and Cheap</strong>: using materials and providing facilities efficiently - including enabling low maintenance, upgrade and extension costs - doesn't need to imply cheap and nasty, or simple and flimsy; a sensible approach would be to try to create a high-quality design utilising low-cost materials and techniques: think robust roundhouses made from sticks and mud (and a few stones)!</li>
</p>

<p>
<li><strong>Sustainability</strong>: this should be easier to achieve with the KISC approach permeating all aspects of design and build; in particular, sensible procedures and designs that minimise waste production and recycle what waste there is, of all sorts, are essential; we need to be in the business of reducing and re-using waste, not increasing it!</li>
</p>
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Some perceived constraints:</h4>
</p>

<ul>
<p>
<li><strong>Distributed versus Centralised</strong>: given that we are building our infrastructure on a highly mobile surface it's probably better to make services distributed, i.e. multiple small sources or activities based in physically limited locations, rather than have long pipes and cables, reservoirs, substations and other centralised paraphernalia liable to physical disruption; a further advantage of distributed services on  expanding (or multi-size) islands is the capacity for expansion without hitting major problems of scale.</li>
</p>

<p>
<li><strong>Building Outward versus Upward</strong>: it may be obvious, but creating multi-storey structures on water surfaces is probably a bad idea, certainly if you're deliberately avoiding monolithic construction technology!, and there's no need for it - the seas and oceans and even river deltas and coastlines are big places, though attention will have to be paid to island transportation and getting the balance right between private and public spaces, e.g. meeting places.</li>
</p>

<p>
<li><strong>High versus Low Surface Density</strong>: as island size increases it may be tempting to increase the density of surface structures to keep total size and travel distance down, but beneath the island is a living ecology whose productivity we wish to encourage, for which a minimum level of light penetration beneath island structures is necessary, so moves to decrease the proportion of open water will have to be resisted!</li>
</p>
</ul>

<p>
Bearing these ideas and constraints in mind, we need a<a href = "How2BuiIslPg6.html"> road map </a>for the design of functional artifacts that both provide primary services such as food, water, power and waste processing, and enable secondary services such as health, education and entertainment.
